A single-page web application for library staff to search for the scanned PDF files.

This is a work still *in slow progress*, as my daily job requires me to focus on the business.

* Motivation
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the library I'm working in has seen a great increase in demand for chapters/pages scan. As many courses move online or the shipping channels are significantly disrupted, scanning a small part of a book for courses is faster and more flexible.

Yet as the number of the scans also increase, it becomes harder for the library staff to check:
1. which chapter (or part) from which book has been scanned
2. where is a specific scan stored in Google Drive

This project aims to solve the problem.
* Disclaimer
As to the allowed scanning range, the library follows such guidelines as the following:
1. up to 2 chapters from a book can be scanned;
2. up to 20% from a book can be scanned
3. whichever of the above comes first, we have to stop scanning
